	Explore the World, question creation guide

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The only file you need to modify in order to make questions is the
"Questions.lua" file located in the addon directory: 
	WoWdir/Interface/Addons/ExploreTheWorld/Questions.lua

To bring up the Explore The World frame, simply write any of the
following commands in the chat window.

	/etw
	/exploretheworld

Lua syntax
----------------------------------------------------------------------
First, lets get you started with some basics of the Lua syntax

Case sensitivity:
	Lua is case-sensitive, which means that if you want to set the
	"answer" attribute but by misstake write "Answer" then the addon
	will find that there is no answers and is then likely to give errors.

String:
	A string is nothing more than sequence of characters encased by
	double quotation marks.

	"This right here is a string"

Number:
	A number is simply a literal number, with any quotations or anything

	54

Boolean:
	Can be either of the following two values:

	true
	false

Table:
	Tables be used for many things, but in this case just think of it as
	a list of items encased by {} brackets. Each item is separated by a
	comma like so:

	{ "string number 1", "another string", 54, "I just threw in a number"}

	So for example, the answer attribute of a question might look like this:

	{ "answer1","answer2", "answer3"}

Variable assignment:
	Variable assignment is nothing more than making an arbitrary name and
	giving a value to it. In our case the variable name specifies which
	attribute we want to set.

	variableName = "stringValue"
	variableName = 54
	variableName = true
	variableName = {"stuff", "stuff2", "morestuff"}


Getting started
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lets start off with a fully functional question and learn from that:

	{
		ID = 2,
		name = "Sorrow by Quilboar",
		category = ETW_TRACKING_CATEGORY,
		modelId = "Mzg1NQ==",
		description = "Living a dry barren land this poor orc had his wife killed by the quilboar, bla bla bla..",
		answer = {"3007b3f7b3762071034b5525693b2be41c01a210b5725669975dabc5be855e4f"},
		zoneRequirementHash = {"8231b7f748e85a746e443e3e16371c434fe51068382472029cad77f64af40fd1"}
	},

Notice how each attribute, or variable, is separated by a comma. This is
because each question is actually a table itself, i.e a list of items,
but in this case, a list of attributes.

What we do here is simply set a bunch of different attributes that together
forms data for a question.

Although notice how "answer" and "zoneRequirementHash" are encased by {}
brackets, this is because they support more than 1 answers/zones even though
we only use one at this specific question.

modelId and modelPath
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As you can see in the above example, the modelId attribute is set to
a weird looking string. This also applies to the modelPath attribute,
but the reason that it looks like this is because it is converted to
base64 format. This is done as one of many extra security things to
not make it completely obvious what the answer to a question is by
opening the Questions.lua file.

In order to convert a path of a model within the WoW directory (Use
WoW Model Viewer to find paths of models) you can either use my
extra converter addon, or use any online website, just google for
"convert base 64" or "encode base 64" and you should find some
alternatives.

The modelId attribute is also converted this way, but instead of
converting a path it converts a number, a displayId. To find the
displayId of an NPC, simply find the NPC on WoWhead. As they allow
you to view the models in 3D you then want to right click and "View
source" of the webpage. Then do "Ctrl-f" (or local equivalent) to
search the webpage for "displayId", next to the place where you find
the text "displayId" should be a number, that's your displayId. Just
convert the displayId to base64 and pop it into the question.

Answers and hashes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
It is not only modelId and modelPath that has their attributes set to
weird looking strings, the answer attribute and all the attributes with
the word "hash" in them uses a sha2 hashing function. To convert to sha2
to have to use my converter addon, it essentially creates a non-reversible
string of letters that can be used to validate for example an answer.

So say you want one of the answer to your question to be "Stormwind", you
then write "stormwind" in the input window of the hashing addon and press
enter. The string in the output window is then copied over to the question:

	answer = {"hashStringForAnswerOneGoesHere", "hashStringForAnswerTwoGoesHere"}

And if you want to make sure you can only answer this question in "Feralas"
or "Tanaris" then you input "feralas" and "tanaris" accordingly into the input
box of the hasing addon and press enter. Then you copy over the string from the
output window to the question:

	zoneRequirementHash = {"hashStringForFeralas", "hashStringForTanaris"}

IMPORTANT: When you hash something, make sure that all letters are LOWERCASE,
because the program converts and answer it receives to lowercase so "abC" isn't
any different from "ABC".

IMPORTANT: You don't have to use LOWERCASE letters anymore because I made
that automatic in the hashing addon, but the paragraph adds a little extra
knowledge anyway.

IMPORTANT: You CAN'T use an online hashing tool for this because WoW's
Lua environment forced me to modify the standard sha2 hashing slightly,
but that means it will yield different results than what online hashing
tools will. The hashing function I used was designed for Lua 5.2 but WoW
uses Lua 5.1.

Attributes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
For information about all the different attributes that exist, please
refer to the "Questions.lua" file located in the addon directory. At
the top of that file is a list of all the attributes that currently
exist.

NOTE: All the attributes doesn't have to be used as you can see on the
other questions, as many attributes have default values and doesn't need
to have their values set.

answer:
	Tracking:
		The answer will always be equal to the name of the NPC
	Investigation:
		The answer will be whatever the user writes, so you'll usually
		want more than one answer if it's not something super obvious.
	Exploration:
		The answer will always be whatever subzone you're in. Say you're
		in Stormwind, and instead of displaying Stormwind it might say
		"The Canals" because we're not interested in the major zones. If
		no subzone exists it will usually take the name of the general area.

zoneRequirementHash:
	This will usually just be a hashed string of for example "tanaris" if the
	question is located in that zone. It ensures the question can only be
	answered if the player is located in one of the zones mentioned in the
	zoneRequirementHash table. It will however also work on subzones if your
	question should require that, like "The Canals" in Stormwind for example.

author:
	Dont forget to give yourself some credit, set this attribute to any
	name you identify yourself with, just make sure it fits in the game.


Bugs and feedback
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to be extra helpful with the addon, take a look at BugSack,
	
	http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/bugsack

It will catch any Lua errors and show where they originated from, those
logs would be useful for feed. Please note however that any errors
mentioning "CompactRaidFrames" are just bugs in the WoW api and should
be ignored, as far as I know anyway.

Also remember to send me feedback on things you think are missing, you're
already part of the development anyway :) Use my new addon e-mail to
contact me for help, send your realId/battleId if you want to chat
in realtime:

	etwaddon@gmail.com



Reporting back with questions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As of now the easiest way to send me questions would be to just mail the
whole Questions.lua file to me, or just cut out your questions, put them
in a separate document and mail that to me.

Please note however that your question is not guaranteed to get used in
the addon, and that I may adjust possible typos and whatnot in your
question.
