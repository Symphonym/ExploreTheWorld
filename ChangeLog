[ Version 0.1.5a ]

	-	Added a frame to the inspect frame showing the ExploreTheWorld rank of the
		player as well as their progress.
	-	Remade how other players ranks are shown to you, instead of sending your rank
		in plain text format (basically allowing people to make all kinds of custom ranks)
		it will send the total amount of quests as well as the number of completed quests.

		client accordingly.
