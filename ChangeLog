[ Version 0.1.5a ] 
	Saturday 18/1-2014 
	-	Remade the client-to-client communcation so the addon only reserves 1 prefix
		for all kinds of messages instead of one prefix for each type of message.
	-	Added a frame to the inspect frame showing the ExploreTheWorld rank of the
		player as well as their progress.
	-	Remade how other players ranks are shown to you, instead of sending your rank
		in plain text format (basically allowing people to make all kinds of custom ranks)
		it will send the total amount of quests as well as the number of completed quests.
		The receiving end will then convert these to percent and grab a rank from their
		client accordingly.
